## PLATFORM-SA-TENANT-DRILLDOWN-CONTEXT (P1)

When SA "View Portal" drills into a tenant, some components query the SA's home tenant 
instead of the drilled-into tenant. Observed today on LiveInbox: 
chatbot_configs?tenant_id=c1bc59a8-... (EngageWorx) fires when viewing Delamere 
(should be 2e057a7a-...).

Same class of bug as Sunday's KB editor tenant resolution (fixed in PR #36 by passing 
tenantId as prop through the component chain).

**Affected**: KBArticleEditor (fixed), LiveInbox (in flight today), likely others
**Audit needed**: every component used in SA drill-down view should receive tenantId 
as prop from parent and use that, not infer from SA's session
**Found**: 2026-05-27 during LiveInbox TDZ debugging  
**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Open

## PLATFORM-MIGRATION-SYSTEM-AUDIT (P2)

Two parallel migration application paths exist in this project:
- `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` tracker (6 entries, May 5-18, mostly abandoned)
- Direct SQL Editor / manual application (all migrations May 24 onward, bypassing tracker)

Need to formalise a single process going forward. Decisions to make:
- Continue with sequential numbered files (018, 019, ...) and skip the tracker
- Or adopt Supabase CLI / timestamp-versioned files with tracker
- Either way, document the process in CLAUDE.md so future contributors and AI 
  assistants don't create more parallel systems

Duplicate file cleanup completed in PR #50 (018-021 renumbered to 032-035).

**Found**: 2026-05-27 during migration file duplicate cleanup
**Priority**: P2 (not blocking, but should be resolved before more tenants onboard)
**Status**: Open

## PLATFORM-AI-PERSONA-STUDIO-UI (P2)

Build the Studio UI to edit the 5 structured AI persona fields (ai_persona, ai_voice, 
ai_scope, ai_escalation_instructions, ai_custom_instructions) plus coordinator_names. 
Foundation work (Migration 028 + assemble-system-prompt.js assembler with && gate) 
already merged. Closing PR #31 left this work paused.

Scope when picked up:
- Editor cards in AI Chatbot Studio for each field
- Persona/voice/scope templates as starting points
- Validation: assembler activates only when ALL 5 populated
- Migration path for tenants with legacy prompts: extract sections into structured 
  fields, preserve the working tone
- Coordinator names as comma-separated input
- Preview pane showing assembled prompt before save

**Found**: 2026-05-27 during PR #31 close
**Priority**: P2 — legacy prompts work; this is upgrade work, not fix work
**Status**: Open — picks up when Studio UX gets a focused session

## PLATFORM-OUTBOUND-EMAIL-FROM-NAME-AUDIT (P2)

Verify outbound email From Name behaviour across all tenants. PR #33 was closed as 
stale; some of its scope (channel_configs.config_encrypted.from_name as authoritative 
source for sendTenantEmail) may not have been independently addressed. Audit: send a 
test outbound from each tenant, confirm From Name matches channel_configs setting. If 
broken, implement as focused new PR.

**Found**: 2026-05-27 during PR triage
**Priority**: P2 (cosmetic, not blocking)
**Status**: Open — audit needed

## PLATFORM-AI-REVIEW-NOTIFICATION-PATH (P1)

When email-inbound.js (and possibly other AI handlers) classify an inbound as 
action: "review" rather than auto_reply, there's no clear notification path to 
the tenant member. Items appear to sit in Live Inbox waiting for someone to 
discover them by manually checking.

Rob confirms he doesn't monitor either Delamere or EngageWorx Live Inbox daily. 
This means review-classified items currently rely on monitoring habit that 
doesn't exist.

Current state (investigated 2026-05-27):
- email_actions row created (status: 'pending') — no notification
- action_items row created IF sp_settings.action_board_enabled = true — no notification
- No email, Slack, push, or badge counter surfaces the item
- Old digest crons retired to no-op (AI Omni Digest sunset)
- Delamere's concierge [ESCALATE] path DOES notify (separate handler) — this gap 
  is specific to the non-concierge email-inbound.js path

Needs:
- Design and build a notification path for review-classified items
- Options: in-portal unread badge on nav, daily digest email to tenant admin, 
  real-time email/push per classification severity
- Particularly important for tenants like Delamere where coordinators run the 
  venue and don't live in the portal

**Found**: 2026-05-27 during PR #54 verification
**Priority**: P1 — affects real operations for any tenant using non-concierge AI handlers
**Status**: Open — investigation complete, design needed
